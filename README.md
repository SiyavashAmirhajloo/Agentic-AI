## Agentic AI — Multi-Agent Projects & Notebooks

Welcome to the **Agentic AI** repository — a collection of simple yet powerful LLM-agent projects inspired by recent research and hackathon winners. This repo is designed both as a playground for experimentation and a foundation for building more sophisticated agentic systems.

### 🧠 What’s Inside

This repository contains:

* Several Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different agentic AI workflows and architectures.
* Projects modeled after *Berkeley RDI LLM Agents Hackathon* winners. ([rdi.berkeley.edu][1])
* Experiments inspired by the *AgentX – AgentBeats* competition. ([rdi.berkeley.edu][2])
* Utility scripts for running agents, evaluating them, and logging their reasoning traces.
* (And more, as this is an evolving codebase.)

You’ll find Google Drive links here (not included in the repo) to raw data, prompt templates, and additional resources, which are used by the notebooks to run and experiment with different agent scenarios:

* Notebook & data folder 1: `…`
* Project files: `…`

### 🚀 Project Highlights

Some of the key agentic AI experiments you’ll see in this repo:

* **Hackathon-style agents**: Notebooks replicating simple yet effective agent designs similar to winners from the Berkeley RDI LLM Agents Hackathon. ([rdi.berkeley.edu][1])
* **AgentX / AgentBeats inspired setups**: Implementations of evaluating agents using green/purple agent paradigms and A2A-style protocols. ([rdi.berkeley.edu][2])
* **Benchmarking & evaluation scripts**: Tools to simulate tasks, log agent decisions, score performance, and visualize agent reasoning.

### 💡 Why This Repository Matters

* **Learning & experimentation**: If you’re new to agentic AI, these notebooks offer hands-on examples to understand agent architectures, reasoning loops, and evaluation.
* **Reproducibility**: The code structure lays a foundation for reproducible agent evaluation, inspired by the AgentBeats evaluation framework. ([GitHub][3])
* **Extendable**: You can plug in your own LLMs, modify the agent logic, connect new tools, or build entirely new evaluation benchmarks.
* **Community-driven**: Reflecting ideas from the AgentX / AgentBeats competitions, the repo encourages building public-good benchmarks and interoperable agents. ([rdi.berkeley.edu][2])

### ✅ Goals & Future Work

* Add more diverse benchmark scenarios (e.g., planning, tool use, safety).
* Incorporate memory or persistence modules for agents.
* Build automated evaluation pipelines and leaderboards.
* Share green-agent benchmarks (inspired by AgentX Phase 1) to evaluate other agents.
* Contribute to the agentic AI community by open sourcing more tasks and agent designs.
